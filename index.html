	<h1>This is why you should go to Las Vegas</h1>
	<p1>The Weather is great, the food is fantastic, and luxury is common there. The sun shines all year and there is a lot of places to find fun there. You could gamble, consume alochol, see live actors, and even fancy light shows you can see all you wouldn't dare to miss. Everthing there is so unique all you problems would be ignored even if society was about to be hit by an asteroid.</p1>
